      <p>It's not the amount that matters but the meaning behind your donation. Giving a little is better than not giving at all. Even the smallest gift to charity can make a huge impact. The efforts of one person can't move mountains</p>

      <h1>Making a donation is the ultimate sign of solidarity. Actions speak louder than words</h1>
      <p>Family giving creates a bond, helping to bolster relationships through a shared goal and raising more money than could otherwise be possible through individual donations. Chances are, many of your family members are already giving to charity, so working together could help you to make even more of a positive impact.</p>
